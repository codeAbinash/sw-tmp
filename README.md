Identifying students who are struggling or at risk of underperformance in any educational
system is a critical challenge. Such students, often called 'weak students,' may face difficulties
for various reasons, including academic challenges, learning disabilities, socio-economic
factors, or lack of motivation. Traditional assessment methods, such as exams and
assignments, may only sometimes provide a comprehensive view of a student's difficulties,
leading to delayed or ineffective interventions. The problem of weak student identification
involves developing a system that can effectively recognize and classify underperforming
students across various metrics, such as academic grades, attendance records, and
participation in classroom activities. Early identification can help educators provide targeted
support and tailored interventions to improve student outcomes.
The proposed software system aims to identify weak students in an educational
environment and provide them with personalized suggestions for necessary changes in their
academic and personal lives. By collecting and analyzing data such as academic performance,
attendance records, participation in class, and behavioral feedback, the system uses machine
learning algorithms to classify students as "weak" or "at-risk." Once identified, the system
generates tailored recommendations for each student, covering areas such as improving study
habits, time management, emotional well-being, and lifestyle changes. For illustration, it may
suggest better study techniques, balanced sleep schedules, or seeking emotional support
through counseling if necessary. The system also features a reporting dashboard for teachers
and administrators to monitor student performance and receive alerts when students are at
risk, enabling early intervention. Additionally, the software continuously tracks student
progress, dynamically updating recommendations based on their improvement or ongoing
struggles. Through this holistic approach, the software seeks to academically and personally
support students, guiding them toward better performance and well-being.
